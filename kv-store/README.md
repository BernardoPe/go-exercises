# Key Value Store

This is a simple in-memory, thread-safe key-value store implemented in Go. It provides basic operations: `Get`, `Set`, and `Delete`, and is safe for concurrent use from multiple goroutines.

This exercise was implemented to practice Go's concurrency features, particularly the use of mutexes for synchronizing access to shared data,
as well as to gain familiarity with Go's generics.
